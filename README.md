# Invoker

Penetration testing utility.

The goal is to use this tool when access to some Windows OS features through GUI is restricted.

Some features require administrative privileges.

Capabilities:

* invoke the Command Prompt and PowerShell,
* download a file,
* add a registry key,
* schedule a task,
* connect to a remote host,
* terminate a running process,
* run a new process,
* dump a process memory,
* inject a bytecode into a running process,
* inject a DLL into a running process,
* list DLLs of a running process,
* install a hook procedure,
* enable access token privileges,
* duplicate an access token of a running process,
* list unquoted service paths and restart a running service,
* replace Sticky Keys.

Built with Dev-C++ IDE v5.11 (64-bit), compiled with TDM-GCC v4.9.2 (32-bit and 64-bit) and tested on Windows 10 Enterprise OS (64-bit). Download Dev-C++ from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/files/Portable%20Releases/).

Made for educational purposes. I hope it will help!

Future plans:

* DLL Proxying,
* COM Hijacking.

## Invoker Library

Check all the capabilities [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/blob/master/src/Invoker/lib/invoker/invoker.cpp). Feel free to use the library.

## How to Run (!!)

Run [\\exec\\Invoker_x86.exe](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/tree/master/exec) (32-bit) or [\\exec\\Invoker_x64.exe](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/tree/master/exec) (64-bit).

32-bit Invoker can only:

* dump the memory of a 32-bit process,
* inject a 32-bit bytecode into a 32-bit process,
* inject a 32-bit DLL into a 32-bit process,
* list DLLs of a 32-bit process,
* install a hook procedure from a 32-bit DLL.

64-bit Invoker can only:

* dump the memory of a 32-bit process,
* dump the memory of a 64-bit process,
* inject a 32-bit bytecode into a 32-bit process,
* inject a 64-bit bytecode into a 64-bit process,
* ~~inject a 32-bit DLL into a 32-bit process,~~
* inject a 64-bit DLL into a 64-bit process,
* ~~list DLLs of a 32-bit process,~~
* list DLLs of a 64-bit process.
* ~~install a hook procedure from a 32-bit DLL,~~
* install a hook procedure from a 64-bit DLL.

## Bytecode Injection

Elevate privileges by injecting bytecode into a higher-privileged process.

This tool can parse an HTTP response and extract the payload from a custom element, e.g. from `<invoker>payload</invoker>` where `payload` is a binary code/file encoded in Base64.

Check the example at [pastebin.com/raw/xf9Trt0d](https://pastebin.com/raw/xf9Trt0d).

This might be useful if antivirus is constantly deleting your local payloads.

Also, check an additional example at [pastebin.com/raw/iW17rCxH](https://pastebin.com/raw/iW17rCxH).

Bytecode provided will most certainly not work for you.

P.S. Pastebin no longer works because it now redirects HTTP to HTTPS.

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to give your local web server a public address.

Too see if a process is 32-bit or 64-bit open up Task Manager -> click on `More details` -> go to `Details` tab -> right click on any of the columns -> click on `Select columns` -> check the `Platform` checkbox.

Additionally, to see if a process is running with administrative privileges check the `Elevated` checkbox.

## Generate a Reverse Shell Payload

Find out how to generate a reverse shell payload from my other [project](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/penetration-testing-cheat-sheet#generate-a-reverse-shell-payload-for-windows-os).

## PowerShell Scripts

Check all the PowerShell scripts used in the main C++ program [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/tree/master/ps).

## Make a DLL With a Hook Procedure

Find out how to make a DLL with a hook procedure [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/blob/master/src/InvokerHook/dllmain.cpp).

Hook procedure will invoke a message box on each window close.

Also, check out a keyboard hook procedure [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/invoker/blob/master/src/KeyboardHook/dllmain.cpp).

P.S. Make sure to remove all the created artifacts after you are done testing, e.g. remove `keylogger.log`.

## Get the LocalSystem Account (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)

Run the Invoker as administrator.

Enable all access token privileges.

Duplicate the access token from e.g. Windows Logon Application (winlogon.exe) and run a new instance of Invoker.

Within the new Invoker instance, open the Command Prompt and run `whoami`, you should now see `nt authority\system`.

Enable all access token privileges once again.

Close the old Invoker instance.

P.S. You get more access token privileges from Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe).
